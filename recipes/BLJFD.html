        <h1>Blackberry-Lemon 
            Jam–Filled Doughnuts</h1>
        <p>Jam– and jelly–filled doughnuts are typically treated to a dusting of 
            confectioners’ sugar. But you can instead use superfine sugar or vanilla 
            sugar (to make, bury 1 or 2 vanilla beans in 2 cups of sugar for 2 weeks). </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 recipe Basic Yeast 
                Doughnuts (page 18)</li>
            <li>1⁄2 lb fresh or frozen 
                blackberries, 
                thawed if frozen</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon </li>
            <li>1⁄4 teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>All-purpose flour, 
                for dusting</li>
            <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1⁄2 cup confectioners’ 
                sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the yeast doughnut dough and let rise until doubled 
                in size, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a bowl, toss together the 
                blackberries and granulated sugar; let stand for 20 minutes. 
                Transfer to a small saucepan, add the lemon zest and juice 
                and salt, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until 
                thickened, 20–25 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, let cool to 
                room temperature, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use. 
                For a smoother consistency, strain the jam through a fine-mesh sieve. </li>
            <li>Punch down the dough, turn it out onto a well-floured work 
                surface, and roll out 1
                ⁄2 inch thick. Using a 21
                ⁄2-inch round 
                cutter, cut out doughnuts. Transfer to a well-floured baking 
                sheet, cover lightly with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, and 
                let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li>To fry the doughnuts, see Successful Frying (page 14). 
                Heat the oil over medium-high until it registers 310–320°F 
                on a deep-frying thermometer. When the doughnuts are 
                cooked through (cut one open to test), 3–4 minutes per 
                side, use a slotted spoon to transfer to a cooling rack or 
                prepared baking sheet. Let cool for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the jam to a pastry bag and cut a 1
                ⁄4-inch opening. 
                Using a small, sharp knife, cut a slit into the side and 
                extending into the center of each doughnut. Insert the 
                cut tip into the slit to the center and pipe in a generous 
                1 tablespoon jam. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and serve. </li>
