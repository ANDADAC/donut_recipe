        <h1>Salted Caramel Doughnuts</h1>
        <p>What started as salted caramel candies in Brittany has blossomed into 
            a mini industry of salted caramel–flavored ice cream, sauce, cakes, and 
            now doughnuts. Fleur de sel or Maldon sea salt is a good choice here. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 recipe Vanilla Old-Fashioned Doughnuts 
                (page 46) </li>
            <li>11⁄2 cups sugar </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh 
                lemon juice </li>
            <li>11⁄2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>11⁄2 teaspoons flaky sea 
                salt, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the vanilla doughnut dough and knead. Roll it 
                out to 1
                ⁄2-inch thickness, cut out doughnuts and holes, 
                and refrigerate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a saucepan, stir together the sugar, lemon 
                juice, and 1
                ⁄4 cup water. Place over medium heat and cook, 
                stirring continuously, until the mixture bubbles vigorously 
                and turns a golden amber color, 7–9 minutes. Remove from 
                the heat and immediately and very carefully add the cream; 
                the mixture will bubble and splatter. Stir until the sauce 
                is smooth, then stir in the sea salt. Let cool until warm.</li>
            <li>To fry the doughnuts, see Successful Frying (page 14). 
                Heat the oil over medium-high until it registers 360°F 
                on a deep-frying thermometer. When the doughnuts are 
                cooked through (cut one open to test), 1–2 minutes per 
                side (holes take less time), use a slotted spoon to transfer 
                to a cooling rack or prepared baking sheet. Let cool for 
                5 minutes. Dip the doughnuts, top side down, into the 
                caramel sauce. Garnish with sea salt and serve.</li>
